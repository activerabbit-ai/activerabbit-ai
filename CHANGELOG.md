## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-03

### ðŸš¨ Major Rails Integration Improvements

This release fixes critical Rails integration issues that prevented reliable exception tracking in production environments.

### Fixed
- **Rails Autoload**: Fixed missing Railtie autoload in main entry point (`lib/active_rabbit.rb`)
- **Exception Middleware**: Properly positioned before `ActionDispatch::ShowExceptions` to catch raw exceptions
- **Rescued Exceptions**: Fixed `process_action.action_controller` subscriber to catch Rails-rescued exceptions
- **Thread Cleanup**: Improved `Thread.current` cleanup in middleware with proper nested request handling
- **Time Dependencies**: Added missing `require "time"` for `iso8601` method across all modules

### Added
- **Shutdown Hooks**: Added `at_exit` and `SIGTERM` handlers for graceful shutdown and data flushing
- **Enhanced Context**: Added timing data, sanitized headers, and better request context
- **Error Isolation**: All tracking operations now fail gracefully without breaking the application
- **Rails 7+ Support**: Handles both `exception_object` (Rails 7+) and legacy `exception` formats
- **Production Resilience**: Never blocks web requests, background sending with automatic retries

### Improved
- **PII Scrubbing**: Enhanced parameter and header sanitization
- **Exception Fingerprinting**: Better grouping of similar exceptions
- **Middleware Safety**: Robust error handling prevents tracking failures from affecting requests
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive Rails integration test suite

### Technical Details
- Rack middleware now placed **before** Rails exception handling (critical for production)
- ActiveSupport::Notifications properly subscribed to catch rescued exceptions
- Background queue with timer-based flushing ensures data delivery
- Thread-safe context management with proper cleanup

This release makes ActiveRabbit production-ready for Rails applications with reliable exception tracking that works even when Rails rescues exceptions and renders error pages.
