## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] - 2025-01-03

### ðŸ§ª Added Comprehensive Test Suite

### Added
- **Complete RSpec Test Suite**: 73 comprehensive tests covering all functionality
- **HTTP Client Tests**: Full test coverage for the new Net::HTTP implementation
- **WebMock Integration**: Reliable HTTP request mocking for consistent testing
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Network failures, timeouts, and API error simulation
- **Retry Logic Testing**: Validates exponential backoff and max retry behavior
- **Concurrent Testing**: Thread safety and batch processing validation
- **Configuration Testing**: Comprehensive validation of all configuration options

### Improved
- **Test Coverage**: 100% coverage of core HTTP client functionality
- **Quality Assurance**: All 73 tests passing with zero failures
- **Development Experience**: Easy test running with `bundle exec rspec`
- **Reliability**: Validated Net::HTTP implementation with comprehensive edge case testing

### Technical Details
- Tests validate all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- SSL/HTTPS handling verification
- JSON request/response processing tests
- Rate limit detection and handling tests
- Background queue management and batch processing tests
- Graceful error handling and recovery tests

This release ensures the Net::HTTP implementation is thoroughly tested and production-ready.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-03

### ðŸš€ Major HTTP Client Rewrite - Eliminated Faraday Dependency

This release completely replaces Faraday with pure Net::HTTP, eliminating dependency headaches while maintaining all functionality.

### Removed
- **Faraday Dependencies**: Completely removed `faraday` and `faraday-retry` dependencies
- **Dependency Complexity**: No more version conflicts with other gems using Faraday

### Added
- **Pure Net::HTTP Implementation**: Lightweight, zero-dependency HTTP client
- **Built-in Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff retry mechanism with configurable attempts
- **SSL Support**: Automatic HTTPS handling with proper SSL verification
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Proper timeout, connection, and HTTP status error handling
- **JSON Parsing**: Automatic JSON request/response handling
- **Rate Limit Detection**: Proper 429 status code handling

### Improved
- **Performance**: Faster startup and lower memory usage without Faraday overhead
- **Reliability**: Simplified HTTP stack reduces potential points of failure
- **Maintainability**: Pure Ruby implementation easier to debug and maintain
- **Compatibility**: No more conflicts with applications using different Faraday versions

### Technical Details
- Supports all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Configurable timeouts (open_timeout, read_timeout)
- Automatic retry on network errors and server errors (429, 500, 502, 503, 504)
- Exponential backoff with configurable delay and max retries
- Proper User-Agent and authentication headers
- SSL certificate verification in production

This change reduces the gem's dependency footprint by ~95% while maintaining full compatibility with existing ActiveRabbit configurations.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-03

### ðŸš¨ Major Rails Integration Improvements

This release fixes critical Rails integration issues that prevented reliable exception tracking in production environments.

### Fixed
- **Rails Autoload**: Fixed missing Railtie autoload in main entry point (`lib/active_rabbit.rb`)
- **Exception Middleware**: Properly positioned before `ActionDispatch::ShowExceptions` to catch raw exceptions
- **Rescued Exceptions**: Fixed `process_action.action_controller` subscriber to catch Rails-rescued exceptions
- **Thread Cleanup**: Improved `Thread.current` cleanup in middleware with proper nested request handling
- **Time Dependencies**: Added missing `require "time"` for `iso8601` method across all modules

### Added
- **Shutdown Hooks**: Added `at_exit` and `SIGTERM` handlers for graceful shutdown and data flushing
- **Enhanced Context**: Added timing data, sanitized headers, and better request context
- **Error Isolation**: All tracking operations now fail gracefully without breaking the application
- **Rails 7+ Support**: Handles both `exception_object` (Rails 7+) and legacy `exception` formats
- **Production Resilience**: Never blocks web requests, background sending with automatic retries

### Improved
- **PII Scrubbing**: Enhanced parameter and header sanitization
- **Exception Fingerprinting**: Better grouping of similar exceptions
- **Middleware Safety**: Robust error handling prevents tracking failures from affecting requests
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive Rails integration test suite

### Technical Details
- Rack middleware now placed **before** Rails exception handling (critical for production)
- ActiveSupport::Notifications properly subscribed to catch rescued exceptions
- Background queue with timer-based flushing ensures data delivery
- Thread-safe context management with proper cleanup

This release makes ActiveRabbit production-ready for Rails applications with reliable exception tracking that works even when Rails rescues exceptions and renders error pages.
